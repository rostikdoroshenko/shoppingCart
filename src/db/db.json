The WIFI was also not the problem as i was clocking 50 MB/s download speeds on my old laptop and could download multiple GBs worth of files while streaming videos without issue",

        "received this model laptop as a loaner because (attention geek squad members) if they take your device to fix it, they can only give you the most barebones laptops they have as a loaner. That is EXACTLY what this is. With a variety of let downs including the useable space on the drive being almost half of the 256GB they advertised, this computer was overheating with the fans going crazy, and lagging to the point of the laptop being unusable for a bit, from a single tab being open, that tab being a simple youtube music video. The WIFI was also not the problem as i was clocking 50 MB/s download speeds on my old laptop and could download multiple GBs worth of files while streaming videos without issue",
        "very fast and surprrizing all the options of the most expensive one and surprisingly fast... big white letters on keyboard easy to read very good screen with 111 ppi !!! at 125% even clearer at 14 iinch then 15.6 inch at 100%! just amazed of this laptop epecially on sale tried many but this one is the best for the price (sale)"
